# Model Driven Operated Micro Cloud with Juju

## Install Juju

You can perform this step on any machine, even one that is not part of the cluster (but that can reach to your micro cloud nodes over the network). To avoid a

```sh
$ multipass shell node1

# we're using --classic as the Juju snap isn't using strict confinement
ubuntu@node1:~$ sudo snap install juju --classic
juju 2.9.12 from Canonicalâœ“ installed
```

## Register our private LXD cloud as a Juju cloud

```sh
# We are going to need the cluster URL of one of the nodes for the next step
ubuntu@node1:~$ lxc cluster ls
